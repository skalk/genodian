              MNT Reform 2 - Use Sculpt OS on SD-card

There is a new, updated Sculpt OS version available for the MNT Reform 2. It
features a fully functional, and more performant SD-card driver. It enables you
to persistently install Sculpt OS and additional depot packages on your MNT
Reform 2. Moreover, the new driver support enables you to exchange the SD-card
dynamically at runtime.

Download and boot Sculpt OS
---------------------------

If you want to test out this still unofficial release of the Sculpt OS for the MNT
Reform 2, you can download a pre-built SD-card image from here:

:Download SD-card image:
  [https://genode.org/files/sculpt/sculpt-mnt-reform2-21.07.img - sculpt-mnt-reform2-21.07.img] _(18 MiB)_ [https://genode.org/files/sculpt/sculpt-mnt-reform2-21.07.img.asc - signature]
  'SHA256 b002ce7a948f3f4969928a61a7483a8e60259714ba19a4dffba3d29fd4fb5c00'

You can copy the image on a fresh SD-card by using 'dd'. Assuming your SD-card
is named '/dev/mmcblk0' when connected to your Linux host machine, then do:

! sudo dd if=sculpt-mnt-reform2-21.07.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 conv=fsync


Building a Sculpt image from scratch
------------------------------------

Alternatively, you can build the Sculpt image on your own. Therefore, you need
to checkout the latest master branch of the Genode repository, as well as the
Genode i.MX 8MQ repository:

! git clone https://github.com/genodelabs/genode.git genode
! cd genode
! git checkout fce525f122db34718ce1710ba7b0233da520ac9b -b mnt_reform2_sculpt
! git clone https://github.com/skalk/genode-imx8mq.git repos/imx8mq
! cd repos/imx8mq
! git checkout bf251edc9743cac2e9585b09d1798d327e4539c1 -b mnt_reform2_sculpt

For all further necessary steps, please follow the instructions of the
[http://genodians.org/skalk/2021-06-03-mnt-reform - first blog post]
about Sculpt OS on MNT Reform 2.

Use the SD-card as installation target
--------------------------------------

After booting Sculpt OS on the MNT Reform 2, you can now select the first (and
only) partition of the SD-card in the storage menu. The dialog that opens allows
you to expand this small partition, which first only contains the boot image.

After the resizing of partition and file-system got effective, you can click
to "use" the partition as target device of the Genode depot. Then you need to connect
the MNT Reform 2 to an ethernet, and select "Wired" in the network dialog in the
right-top corner.

Finally, choose the "+" sign above the storage dialog, "Depot". and
"Selection". From the selection that opens, you can choose the "skalk"
repository as depot package source.

Now, you will be able to install all Genode depot packages, which you
might already know from the PC variant of Sculpt OS.

Have fun!

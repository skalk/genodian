                  Sculpt OS 21.10 on ARM

Beside the x86 architecture, the new Sculpt OS 21.10 can also be used on top of
the MNT Reform 2 and i.MX 8MQ EVK board. Although those ARMv8-based boards are
not yet officially supported, you can give it a first try.

Under the hood, the new Sculpt release for these ARM boards includes optimized
power management, new drivers for EMMC/SD-card, and USB devices. On top of
Sculpt you can try out the VMM for ARM64 package to execute a Linux guest. Of
course all generic Sculpt packages are available as well, e.g., the Falkon
webbrowser package.

Download and boot Sculpt OS
---------------------------

If you want to test out the unofficial release of the Sculpt OS for the MNT
Reform 2 or i.MX 8MQ EVK board, you can download a pre-built SD-card
image from here:

:Download SD-card image for MNT Reform 2:
  [https://genode.org/files/sculpt/sculpt-mnt_reform2-21.10.img - sculpt-mnt_reform2-21.10.img] _(17 MiB)_ [https://genode.org/files/sculpt/sculpt-mnt_reform2-21.10.img.asc - signature]

You can copy the image on a fresh SD-card by using 'dd'. Assuming your SD-card
is named '/dev/mmcblk0' when connected to your Linux host machine, then do
either:

! sudo dd if=sculpt-mnt_reform2-21.10.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 conv=fsync

or:

! sudo dd if=sculpt-imx8q_evk-21.10.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 conv=fsync

depending on which board you are trying to use Sculpt on top.

Building a Sculpt image from scratch
------------------------------------

The unofficial Sculpt OS 21.10 for ARMv8 needs few tweaks in addition to the
official Sculpt release for the x86 PC. Therefore, you need to checkout the
corresponding topic branch from my Genode repository:

! git clone https://github.com/skalk/genode.git genode
! cd genode
! git checkout origin/sculpt_21.10 -b sculpt_21.10

Then you need to add the dedicated repository for the i.MX family, which
contains all kernel and driver ingredients for the MNT Reform 2, and i.MX 8MQ
EVK board:

! git clone https://github.com/skalk/genode-imx.git repos/imx
! cd repos/imx
! git checkout origin/sculpt_21.10 -b sculpt_21.10
! cd ../..

Of course, you will need the Genode toolchain 21.05, either you install it into
your development environment, see the
[https://genode.org/download/tool-chain - toolchain download page],
or you take the Docker container available, see article
[http://genodians.org/skalk/2020-09-29-docker-devel - Genode development container]
for more details.

Before, you can build Sculpt, you have to download all 3rd party sources needed
first:

! tool/ports/prepare_port bash coreutils curl dde_linux dde_rump e2fsprogs-lib gnupg imx8q_evk_uboot jitterentropy libarchive libc libgcrypt libpng libssh mnt_reform2_linux mnt_reform2_uboot ncurses openssl stb ttf-bitstream-vera vim xz zlib

Now, you can create the necessary depot packages. If you want to build it for
the i.MX 8MQ EVK board, please change 'mnt_reform2' in the following to
'imx8q_evk'

! tool/depot/create genodelabs/pkg/arm_v8a/sculpt-mnt_reform2 genodelabs/bin/arm_v8a/base-hw-mnt_reform2 CROSS_DEV_PREFIX=/usr/local/genode/tool/21.05/bin/genode-aarch64- UPDATE_VERSIONS=1 -j8

To finally create the system's image, we need a build directory first:

! tool/create_builddir arm_v8a

and add the 'imx' repository to the 'REPOSITORIES' variable in
'build/arm_v8a/etc/build.conf':

! REPOSITORIES += $(GENODE_DIR)/repos/imx

Moreover, you have to enable the following repositories that are commented out
by default:

! REPOSITORIES += $(GENODE_DIR)/repos/libports
! REPOSITORIES += $(GENODE_DIR)/repos/ports
! REPOSITORIES += $(GENODE_DIR)/repos/dde_linux
! REPOSITORIES += $(GENODE_DIR)/repos/dde_rump
! REPOSITORIES += $(GENODE_DIR)/repos/gems

By adding:

! BOARD_RUN_OPT(mnt_reform2) := --include image/imx8mq_mmc
! BOARD_RUN_OPT(imx8q_evk)   := --include image/imx8mq_mmc

you include a run-tool plugin to produce a ready-to-boot SD-card image for
i.MX 8MQ centered target boards. Which will include the corresponding
bootloader, Sculpt system image, and GPT partition scheme. Finally, you build
this image via:

! cd build/arm_v8a
! make run/sculpt KERNEL=hw BOARD=mnt_reform2

or respectively:

! make run/sculpt KERNEL=hw BOARD=imx8q_evk

The resulting image is located at 'var/run/sculpt.img', and can be written to
an SD-card, like described at the beginning of this post.

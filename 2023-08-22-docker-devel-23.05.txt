           Docker image with Genode toolchain 23.05

The pre-built docker image to easily develop Genode on top of arbitrary host
systems got updated to a more recent Ubuntu 22.04 base system. Moreover, it now
contains the last Genode toolchain 23.05., Qemu 6.2, and all necessary host
tools to run any kernel, board, and run-script combination.

The docker image is located at:

[https://genode.org/files/genode-docker-23.05-image.tar]

Its SHA1 hashsum is:

! d1b1dc92cd957a43046852497a12e51081adea1a genode-docker-23.05-image.tar

For convenience reasons, and for all those who are not familiar with using
docker, you can use a small wrapper tool. It comprises the steps to download and
import the Genode development image, as well as to start a development
container. At the same location you will find the recipe to build the very same
docker image on your own. Just checkout the following repository:

! git clone https://github.com/skalk/genode-devel-docker.git

To learn about how to use this little utility, please refer to the
[https://genodians.org/skalk/2020-09-29-docker-devel - initial blog post] about it.

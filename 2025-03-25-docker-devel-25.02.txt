           Docker image based on Ubuntu 24.04

The pre-built docker image to easily develop Genode on top of arbitrary host
systems got updated to a more recent Ubuntu 24.04 base system. Moreover, it now
contains the Genode toolchain 23.05., Qemu 8.2, AMT tools to remote control x86
hardware, CTAGs tools to facilitate Linux device driver porting, and all
necessary host tools to run almost any kernel, board, and run-script
combination. Please note: for the time being OKL4-based scenarios cannot be
build using this container, because its tooling depends on the ancient Python
2.6.

The docker image is located at:

[https://genode.org/files/genode-docker-25.02-image.tar]

Its SHA1 hashsum is:

! 14661b5e86f7a2b655acac44c1a95c6e46dc8303 genode-docker-25.02-image.tar

For convenience reasons, and for all those who are not familiar with using
docker, you can use a small wrapper tool. It comprises the steps to download and
import the Genode development image, as well as to start a development
container. At the same location you will find the recipe to build the very same
docker image on your own. It also helps those, who do not want to use docker,
but want to reproduce what is needed in a Debian/Ubuntu based Linux environment.
Just checkout the following repository:

! git clone https://github.com/skalk/genode-devel-docker.git

To learn about how to use this little utility, please refer to the
[https://genodians.org/skalk/2020-09-29-docker-devel - initial blog post] about it.

_Edit (2025-04-08): updated image hashsum due to image update_

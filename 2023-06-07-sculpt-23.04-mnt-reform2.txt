                  Sculpt OS 23.04 on MNT Reform2

Though so much time has passed since the last Sculpt OS release for MNT Reform2,
the development did not stop, and I proudly present version 23.04 to you.
This new release includes some interesting features related to our beloved MNT
Reform2 laptop, namely:
* NVMe and Wifi support (both via PCIe)
* System-update functionality
* Presets to easily try out certain runtime scenarios including virtualization

Installation
------------

# You can download a pre-built SD-card image from here:
  [https://depot.genode.org/skalk/image/]
  You can find the disk image in two forms, as compressed .img.xz file or
  contained in a .zip file. You may check the downloaded image's integrity with
  GnuPG using the accompanied .sig files and my
  [https://github.com/genodelabs/genode/tree/master/repos/gems/sculpt/depot/skalk - public key].
# Copy the image on a fresh SD-card by using 'dd'. Assuming your SD-card is
  named '/dev/mmcblk0' when connected to your Linux host machine, then do:
  ! $ xz -d sculpt-mnt_reform2-<version>.img.xz
  ! $ sudo dd if=sculpt-mnt_reform2-<version>.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 conv=fsync
# Boot the MNT Reform2 with the SD-card inserted. After around 10 seconds, the
  user interface should appear.
# Extend the Genode partition to the full size of the SD card. Alternatively,
  you can of course use/format another storage media as Genode partition, like NVMe,
  eMMC, or USB stick, but then you won't be able to use the system-update
  functionality for now! The downloaded image contains a tiny partition only
  capable to hold the base system. Therefore, you need to expand it to the
  SD-card's actual capacity to have room for applications and data.
  * Select the "Storage" section
  * Select the SD-card (typically mmcblk1, better double-check it by comparing the capacity)
  * Select the partition "1"
  * Select "Expand" and confirm the operation
  * After some time, dependent on the SD-card capacity, you should see the
    partition size has changed
# Make the expanded partition the default using the 'Default' button.

Quickstart
----------

After booting, the first screen that you see is the so called "Leitzentrale"
that gives the user full control over the system.

Once you've chosen a storage media to be used by Sculpt, e.g. the SD-card
partition containing the boot image (refer to installation section), a 'System'
button occurs in the top-left corner of the screen. It gives you the choice in
between of several 'Presets', and a system update dialog. A preset is a bunch of
Genode components bundled together to form one specific runtime scenario.

Before you can start a preset for the first time, you need to select what kind
of network connectivity you favor, because additional packages might need to get
installed. The 'Network' button can be found in the top-right corner of the
"Leitzentrale". You're able to choose in between wired, and wireless uplinks, at least
if a PCIe WiFI card is present in you MNT Reform2.

The following presets can be tested out easily:

:empty:
  Resets the runtime to the initial state with no components present.

:window manager:
  Starts a window manager and background image together with a UNIX-like system
  shell. The system shell' environment is formed so that you can edit the
  configuration file-system of several fundamental components (e.g. drivers,
  resource multiplexers), and see reports from them. Moreover, you can access your
  installation file-system under '/rw'.

:falkon web browser:
  Web browser based on the Chromium engine and Qt5. It is hugely complex. Hence
  your patience is needed while downloading and extracting it. The browser is
  configured such that no state is stored persistently by using the ram fs as
  location for the browser cache, cookies, and downloads. You can wipe this
  information using "Reset" button of the ram-fs component in the runtime graph.

:debian installer:
  Starts a tiny Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) that executes a Debian Linux
  installer. As storage backend, a Virtual Disk Image (VDI) is created under
  'recall/debian_installer/vdi_block/block.vdi/block.vdi' within your
  installation medium. Once, you've passed the installation process till
  the end, you might take the image as starting point for a persistent Linux VM.

To toggle in between the 'Runtime' showing the actual applications, and the
"Leitzentrale", please press the 'F12' key.

Apart from these presets you can shape your own runtime using the component
graph in the middle of the "Leitzentrale", like in an other Sculpt OS variant
already before.

For further information about the concepts and usage of Sculpt, please refer to
the [https://genode.org/documentation/articles/sculpt-23-04 - documentation page]
of the PC version.

Building your own Sculpt image from scratch
-------------------------------------------

To build Sculpt OS 23.04 for MNT Reform2 you need a recent version of the
'genode' and 'genode-imx' repositories from Genode Labs account. Additionally to
integrate the virtualization preset, you need additional ingredients from my
personal genode-chest repository:

! $ git clone https://github.com/genodelabs/genode.git     genode
! $ git clone https://github.com/genodelabs/genode-imx.git genode/repos/imx
! $ git clone https://github.com/skalk/genode-chest.git    genode/repos/chest-skalk

Don't forget to add the additional repositories to the 'REPOSITORIES' variable
of your build environment.

Of course, you will need the Genode toolchain 23.05. You can get it from
Genode's [https://genode.org/download/tool-chain - toolchain download page].

To build a Sculpt OS image for MNT Reform2 issue the following in your build
directory:

! build/arm_v8a$ make run/sculpt_image KERNEL=hw BOARD=mnt_reform2 DEPOT=omit
